Natural Language can be in form of text or sound, which are used for humans to communicate each other. NLP can enable humans to communicate to machines in a natural way. \n\n\n**Text Classification** is a process involved in Sentiment Analysis. It is classification of peoples opinion or expressions into different sentiments. Sentiments include *Positive, Neutral*, and *Negative*, *Review Ratings* and *Happy, Sad*. Sentiment Analysis can be done on different consumer centered industries to analyse people's opinion on a particular product or subject. \n![Sentiment Analysis](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQHPAZFZZxBtng/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0?e=1593648000&v=beta&t=eQAR5WOihE2_ZCCAJbsgNyJlaI_GW7u8lDw45zGbfuU)\n> Sentiment Classification is a perfect problem in NLP for getting started in it.
